# We've Moved!

The official Franka GitHub organization has been renamed to [**frankarobotics**](https://github.com/frankarobotics).

## Why The Change
This isnâ€™t just a rename â€” itâ€™s a reflection of our evolving mission and future-facing vision. The new GitHub identity better represents who we are today and the direction weâ€™re heading together: creating tools, knowledge, and possibilities for developers, researchers, and roboticists pushing boundaries worldwide.

## What This Means for You

- GitHub **automatically redirects** web links to repositories, so browsing to old URLs will continue to work.
- However, **cloning** repositories using the old URLs will no longer work after the migration.
- Please **update your git remotes, bookmarks, and integrations** to use the new org name.
- All official resources and repositories are now under `frankarobotics`.
